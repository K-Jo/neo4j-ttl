== Neo4j Time To Live Extension

Adds a customizable time-to-live mechanism to Neo4j.

=== Approach

Uses indexed properties, range searches, and detach delete.

=== Installation

* Clone this repository and run `mvn install -DskipTests`
* Also copy `target/neo4j-ttl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the `plugins` folder
* Modify `conf/neo4j.properties` accordingly (see the Example section)
* Restart Neo4j

=== Example

If you configure in `conf/neo4j.properties`:

----
ttl.label=Timed
ttl.property=ttl
ttl.schedule=60s
----

With that in place, Neo4j will now track changes to nodes labeled
`Timed` and expires them after their `ttl` property is smaller than the current `timestamp()`


=== Todo

* Support expiring of relationships
